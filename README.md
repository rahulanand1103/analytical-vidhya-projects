* Beginner Level: This level comprises of data sets which are fairly easy to work with, and don’t require complex data science techniques. You can solve them using basic regression or classification algorithms. Also, these data sets have enough open tutorials to get you going. In this list, we have also provided tutorials to help you get started. You can also check out AV’s ‘Introduction to Data Science‘ course along with this!
* Intermediate Level: This level comprises of data sets which are more challenging in nature. It consists of mid & large data sets which require some serious pattern recognition skills. Also, feature engineering will make a difference here. There is no limit on the use of ML techniques; everything under the sun can be put to use.
* Advanced Level: This level is best suited for people who understand advanced topics like neural networks, deep learning, recommender systems etc. High dimensional datasets are also featured here. Also, this is the time to get creative. See the creativity best data scientists bring into their work and codes.
